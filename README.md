## First Review Done at Makers Academy
done on 02/07/2020  - week 8 in the course

### Verbal Feedback
* use the simplest test that will fail to develop code, outside in not inside out (chat to a coach about this)
* make sure to pass test before refactoring, horrible logic that doesn't require deleting of previous code is simplier, despite being horrifically ugly
* test edge cases last, also edge cases are defined by unexpected input to a function of feature path rather than deviation from default output type.
